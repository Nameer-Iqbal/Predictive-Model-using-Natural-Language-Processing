Develop a comprehensive dataset consisting of a minimum of 500 records in a category or domain of your choice, such as user reviews, social media comments, medical prescriptions, or excerpts from literature. 1.	Identify and apply applicable range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and techniques to preprocess and analyze the data. These might include tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, and Information Extraction, among other. Word2Vec is used to represent words as vectors (array). These vectors capture the meaning of words by placing similar words close to eachother in the vector space. LDA model is used to find hidden topics within a collection of documents. Each document is viewed as a mixture of topic and each topic is a mixture of words.
